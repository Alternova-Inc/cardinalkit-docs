# App Customization Guide

## Configuration Options

CardinalKit provides quick customization options for your health research application through the **CKConfiguration.plist** file, located in the **/CardinalKit-Example/Supporting Files** folder. This file is a spreadsheet that maps CardinalKit-defined keys to user-selected values. This reference shows you how to customize that file to suit your needs. Every key must have a value or the app will crash.

The default CardinalKit sample app with no CKConfiguration.plist changes.
